# Wordpress Development Guidelines

This document provides a set of rules for writing Wordpress themes & plugins.

## Syntax and Formatting
### General
- An .editorconfig file MUST be present

### Theme development for themes based on [Sage](https://github.com/roots/sage)
- Follow the rules defined in Sage's [.editorconfig](https://github.com/roots/sage/blob/master/.editorconfig) file
-- This means templates must use *2 spaces* for indentation
- Follow [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/)
- Use [PHP Code Sniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer)

### Plugin development
- Same as above
- Following the rules defined in Roots\Sage [.editorconfig](https://github.com/roots/sage/blob/master/.editorconfig) is optional
-- However, in this case you MUST have an .editorconfig file
